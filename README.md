# VisualTweets

I had a lot of trouble doing this lab, I initially wanted to run a twitter sweep of all #ukraine posts, but the google colab script woulnâ€™t produce any such file in my google drive or local hard drive. I also tried running it from VSCode, and tried adding 
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
to the end, while changing the drive location to my email address. Neither worked, even when I used a non-UW email. 

I managed to complete everything else, including the word cloud and map. I feel disappointed, thank you for allowing me extra time.
